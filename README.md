## In-Game Card Creator ##

Does as the title says.  
**To access the card creator, use the backroom door handle.**

Cards are saved to the `BepInEx/plugins/IGCCExports` folder.  
If using a mod manager, the folder can be found by selecting "Browse profile folder" in the mod manager settings.  
If using a manual install, you should know where the BepInEx folder is.

Note that IGCC creates cards for JSONLoader, so you are free to uninstall/disable IGCC when you are done creating cards.  

Please remember to assign a custom prefix to the cards if you want to publish them for others to use.

Any valid portraits in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder (and subfolders) will be loaded as portraits.    
Portraits are 114x94 pixels. Any images of different sizes will not be loaded.  
If you want to use a custom portrait, just put it anywhere in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.  
Any file with the same name as a portrait file suffixed by `_emission` will be loaded as an emission map for the portrait.
